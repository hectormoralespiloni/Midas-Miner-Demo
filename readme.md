# Midas Miner demo (May 2015)
_Basic Midas Miner game demo (http://www.royalgames.com)_

This is a Midas Miner game demo made in C++ and SDL, it only has 1 harcoded level, maybe in the future I will update it to support more levels.

You have 60 seconds to remove 3 or more chains or rocks before everything blows up!
